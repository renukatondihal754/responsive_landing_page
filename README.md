## ðŸ“± Responsiveness Breakdown

### âœ… Mobile (â‰¤ 768px)
- **Hero section** switches to `column` layout
- Navigation menu becomes a hamburger icon (`.menu-toggle`)
- Font sizes and padding are reduced for smaller screens
- Image width becomes 100% and centered

### âœ… Tablet (768px â€“ 1100px)
- Previously, the layout stayed in a `row` flex mode, leading to extra white space
- This has been fixed by updating the media query to target **all tablet ranges**
- Now the `.hero-section` also stacks **vertically on tablets**
